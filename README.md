# hello-world

Hello I am trying to understand Git more and more, I want to take this and Docker and use these instead of Virtual Machines.
I am trying to figure out a way for this to happen, and this is my testing platform to do so.

DEV - TEST - CERT - PROD - Is the way we test our applications, we move from DEV or TEST to CERT, then from CERT to PROD for the 
end-user to experience.

Here is a brief commit, or change to my read me file.
